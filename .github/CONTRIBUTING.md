> Thanks for considering on contributing!

Before we get started, I would like for you to read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you continue. It's useful to know that we are all here to help each other, and that we are all expected to follow our own [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways on contributing
### Bug Reports
If you find a bug report, please report it in the **issues** section in this repository labeled `bug`.

Before you go on a rampage on bug reporting, please follow our guidelines before doing so:

- Be clear and concise with the title, it will help others link their issues and solutions to yours.
- Specify the ways to reproduce the bug, so our development team and contributors can reproduce by themselves.
- Show the output, using logs and screenshots, to help others understand your issue.
- If you're running a self-hosted version of **Tsubaki**, specify the specs you're running, distribution (locally, Docker), and the version and git commit hash before you report the bug.

### Security Issues
If you find a security issue, please contact us at **security@arisu.land** and we will work with you to report the issue.
