# Hana (èŠ±, "flower")
> ðŸ¥€ **èŠ± ("hana"; flower) is a API to proxy different APIs.**

## Installation
No. I will not provide instructions on how to configure Hana (`api.floofy.dev`), it's basically: if you know how to, do it yourself.

Only thing I'll say is you need Node.js (v16 is used in development but over v14 is good!), Redis (v6.2 is used in development but over v6 should be good), and a S3 bucket (with Amazon or Wasabi is supported.)

See ya! :wave:
