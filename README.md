# Hana (èŠ±, "flower")
> ðŸ¥€ **èŠ± ("hana"; flower) is a API to proxy different APIs.**

## Installation
No. I will not provide instructions on how to configure Hana (`api.floofy.dev`), it's basically: if you know how to, do it yourself.

Only thing I'll say is you need Node.js (v16 is used in development but over v14 is good!) and a S3 bucket (with Amazon or Wasabi is supported.)

See ya! :wave:
