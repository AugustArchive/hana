# Hana
> ðŸ¥€ **èŠ± (Hana) is a API to proxy different APIs like GitHub Sponsors, source code for [api.floofy.dev](https://api.floofy.dev)**

## Installation
No. I will not provide instructions on how to configure Hana (`api.floofy.dev`), it's basically: if you know how to, do it yourself.

Only thing I'll say is you need Node.js (v16 is used in development but over v14 is good!) and a S3 bucket (with Amazon or Wasabi is supported.)

See ya! :wave:
